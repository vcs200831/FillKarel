# FillKarelKarel Filling the World with Beepers
This program uses the Stanford Karel library to simulate a simple task of filling the world with beepers. Karel, a virtual robot, moves through the world and places beepers in a pattern until the entire world is filled.

Program Overview
The main() function is the entry point of the program. It contains a loop that runs as long as there is a clear path ahead of Karel. Within the loop, Karel calls the put_beeper_line() function to place a line of beepers in the current row. After placing the beepers, Karel calls the reset_position() function to move to the next row and repeat the process.

The put_beeper_line() function places a beeper at the current position and then moves forward until it reaches the end of the row, placing beepers along the way.

The reset_position() function turns Karel around, moves it to the end of the row, turns it to the right, moves it forward, and then turns it to the right again. This positions Karel at the beginning of the next row.

The turn_around() and turn_right() functions are helper functions that rotate Karel in the desired direction.

Running the Program
To run the program, make sure you have the Stanford Karel library installed in your Python environment. You can install it using the pip install stanfordkarel command.

Once you have the library installed, you can run the program in an IDE or text editor that supports Python, such as PyCharm. Simply execute the program, and the Karel simulation window will open, showing Karel's actions as it fills the world with beepers.

Feel free to customize the program or modify the code to create different patterns or behaviors for Karel. Have fun exploring the capabilities of the Stanford Karel library!

Requirements
Python 3.x
